# Mobile App Development template

This is a template maintained by [Matsuuu](https://github.com/Matsuuu) and has an opinionated approach to cross-platform mobile development.

The template comes fitted with a collection of standalone libraries, which can be used as-is, or replaced with alternatives without a bigger hassle.

As time goes on, this repository will be populated with more of a toolkit and best practices I've found while developing mobile software.

**This repository is mostly for my own reference, but if you find use out of it, feel free to utilize it!**
